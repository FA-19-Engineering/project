Let's make some user stories!

First Batch -- First Iteration

1) I am a User who can view a site (mockup local site fine at this stage.)
# means we will have to select a framework and webserver
# I'm thinking Django and Nginx


2) As a user I can log in to the site
# account authentication confirmation Email

3) I am a user who can enter and view my movie preferences.
 
4) The site will reference IMDB for recent movies matching User Criteria

Second Batch ? -- Under Development

5) The Site will email User with movie matches
