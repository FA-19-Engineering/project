Let's make some user stories!

First Batch -- First Iteration

1) I am a User who can view a site (mockup local site fine at this stage.)
# means we will have to select a framework and webserver
# I'm thinking Django and Nginx


# 2) As a user I can log in to the site
# Josh -> I feel like this should be a later iteration and not a main priority for this story
# account authentication confirmation Email

2) I am a user who can enter and view my movie preferences.
3) I can search for a movie by categories
4) Clicking on one of the movies that matches my search brings me to a page that lists details about the movie
3) The site will reference IMDB for recent movies matching User Criteria

Second Batch ? -- Under Development

4) The Site will email User with movie matches
