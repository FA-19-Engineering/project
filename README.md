# project
Hey team! I guess the first thing to do now that you are here is to 
make a clone of the project repository. After that, make a branch of that clone. 
This branch is where your changes will be made, which will then be merged in to the master
branch of the project.

Github has spaces for dialogue and advanced collaboration features. We probably won't need most
of them, but feel free to explore and report back if you spot anything you think we could use.
I am by no means a git pro, but we should be able to make this a good code base if we don't 
get too tricky. 

I think Windows has a desktop Git client too, so you may want to check that out.
